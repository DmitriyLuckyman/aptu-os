Q: Second sample is INVALID, because offset is 0x02407000, but granularity bit is not seted and segment limit is 0xfffff. If offset is greater than segment size address has been invalidated.
A: AFAIU granularity bit is set. Run in terminal the following (obtain the 55th bit from a segment) to verify:
> echo $((0x008f90000000ffff & (1 << (23 + 32))))
36028797018963968

FYI committed implementation is false-negative (returns INVALID even if address can be calculated).

fixed.
