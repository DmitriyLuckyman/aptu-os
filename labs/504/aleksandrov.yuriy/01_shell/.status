* ls had fixed (note: ls can have one argument — path (default = .))
* ps had fixed
* ps had implemented as shared library libps.so (./shell is bash-scipt where libpath sets and then ./shell.bin runs) — lib interface is in libps.h (for shell.c), lib source code is in ps.c
* Ctrl+C capturing had implemented
