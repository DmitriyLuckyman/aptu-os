1. Both sieve_multith and sieve_unith should output only if -p option is set.
2. Looks like your implementation has a bug:
06_sieve> ./sieve_multith 10000 2
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::system_error'
  what():  Enable multithreading to use std::thread: Operation not permitted
Aborted (core dumped)

3. "Conclusion" in REPORT implies some sort explanation, not simple data description.

4. 10000 is too small for upper bound. ~10^9 should be used, step is 1 (log scale)

rejected

1. Update status after your fixes
2. Analyze on your measurements and add conclusion to REPORT as 6th task requires. Make sure your are using correct encoding.

Build error.
